## Anomaly Analysis
## Insert Anomaly

In the dataset, product-related columns such as product_id, product_name, category, and unit_price are always tied to an order_id.

Example rows:

Row with order_id = ORD1027 (product: Notebook)

Row with order_id = ORD1002 (product: Headphones)

Problem:
There is no row where a product exists without an order.
This means a new product (e.g., a new laptop) cannot be inserted unless an order is created.

Columns involved:
product_id, product_name, unit_price, order_id

Conclusion:
This is an Insert Anomaly because the system does not allow independent insertion of product data.

## Update Anomaly

The product “Pen Set” appears in multiple rows:

Example rows:

order_id = ORD1114

order_id = ORD1153

order_id = ORD1118

order_id = ORD1132

order_id = ORD1037

(All these rows have product_name = 'Pen Set' and same price)

Problem:
If the unit_price of “Pen Set” changes (e.g., 250 → 300),
it must be updated in all these rows.

Risk:
If one row is missed → inconsistent data

Columns involved:
product_name, unit_price

Conclusion:
This is an Update Anomaly because duplicate data must be updated in multiple places.

## Delete Anomaly

Consider this row:

Example:

order_id = ORD1002

product_id = P005

product_name = Headphones

Problem:
If this row is deleted and it is the only occurrence of that product in some cases,
then all information about the product is lost.

This includes:

product name

category

price

Columns involved:
order_id, product_id, product_name

## Conclusion:
This is a Delete Anomaly because deleting an order can remove important product data.

These anomalies arise because multiple entities such as customers, products, orders, and sales representatives are stored in a single table, violating normalization principles.

## Normalization Justification

Keeping all data in a single table may seem simpler initially, but it introduces serious data integrity and maintenance issues. In the given dataset, customer, product, and sales representative information is repeated across multiple rows for every order. This redundancy leads to update anomalies. For example, if a product’s price changes, it must be updated in every row where that product appears. Missing even one row results in inconsistent data.

Similarly, insert anomalies occur because new entities cannot be added independently. A new product cannot be inserted into the system unless it is associated with an order, which is impractical for inventory management. Delete anomalies are also problematic; removing an order may unintentionally delete important information about customers, products, or sales representatives.

By normalizing the data into separate tables such as Customers, Products, Orders, and Sales Representatives, we eliminate redundancy and ensure data consistency. Each entity is stored only once, and relationships are maintained using foreign keys. This design improves scalability, reduces storage duplication, and ensures that updates, inserts, and deletes can be performed safely without unintended data loss.

Therefore, normalization is not over-engineering but a necessary step to ensure data integrity, consistency, and long-term maintainability of the system.
